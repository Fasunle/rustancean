# Who are the Rustaceans?
I started my journey of learning rust language and I have decided to document my learning experience along the way.

I started to learn rust-lang because I believe it is the future programming language which on must know earlier or later.

It will definately be hard but I must continue.

#### I will be specializing in web3 space of rust. That is, how to develop smart contract applications and systems.
